# Unexpected Tailwind CSS behavior with responsive modifiers

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using specific Tailwind CSS utility classes in combination with responsive modifiers. The layout breaks unpredictably on certain screen sizes.  The issue seems to be related to the interaction between [specific classes involved] and how Tailwind applies them based on screen size.  The solution involves a more strategic approach to class application or perhaps a workaround using custom CSS.
